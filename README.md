# CS230-The-Gaming-Room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The gaming room client wanted their game to be accessable to more than just android users. The game is based on the 1980's game win, lose, or draw and it will play similarly were the multiple teams guess the image before the time runs out.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I think my evaluation of each operating platform did a good job at explaining the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each operating platform very well.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I think the design document allows me to keep on track of what is done and what needs to be done, along with following along with what the client wants while also seeing the benifits of each operating platforms.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  In my recomandations i didn't go much into depth on distributed systems and networks and security which I would have liked to include if I did a revision.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user wanted a way to play the game on multible platforms and by offering a server-client apprach it will be possible so by taking the user's needs into consideration while designing I was able to come up with an appropriate apprach.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  When designing software I like to work in smaller parts to ensure each part is working correctly, by doing so I am able to reduce bugs and most importantly headaches. Something I often times overlook is writing down how I am going design software so using flowcharts are psedocode is something I would like to use in the future.
